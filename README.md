### Criteria:
Your project should connect to our theme of social good, using technology to improve peopleâ€™s lives or communities. You can build anything that could benefit society, solve societal problems, and improve accessibility. 

### Problem:
*Hate is on the rise.*   

Growing up, I was the only non-white kid in my class for most of elementary school. Yet I was never made to feel different. For the most part, I was welcomed with open arms and was treated like any other kid. My sister on the other hand, is living a very different life. While the class is more diverse, it is no longer as welcoming. Children as young as 6 are behaving in a racist manner and are hating their classmates for something they have no control over. With the rise of hate on social media and with children accessing such content at a younger and younger age, we need a beacon of hope amidst the darkness to spread a message of friendship and acceptance despite our differences 

### Solution:
Calling this a solution to such a large and widespread problem feels a little disingenuous, but I hope it can be a small piece in the larger puzzle of combating hate. Studies show that exposure to diversity, including seeing diverse people, learning about different cultures, and hearing different languages, is linked to increased tolerance and reduced prejudice in children. Research indicates that frequent, positive interactions and learning opportunities with diverse peers and materials can lead to better social skills, higher empathy, and more open-mindedness. [1]  
 
In comes **"Globetrotter"**, a scavenger hunt game that takes you around the world. Meet different people and explore various cultures, art, food, and traditions as you search for historical artifacts from around the globe. Essentially, the game is a good trojan horse, a fun game for kids to play while learning about the beautiful diversity that encompasses humanity.
